  "body": "In the realm of quantitative finance, randomness is more than a mathematical abstraction—it's the heartbeat of every model, the pulse behind every simulation. From stochastic gradient descent in deep learning to Monte Carlo simulations for risk estimation, randomness underpins much of modern financial modeling. And yet, for all our reliance on it, our tools for generating randomness remain curiously artificial—algorithms designed to simulate chance but never quite reaching its essence. As the frontier of computing begins to tap into quantum phenomena and even astronomical noise, a provocative question emerges: What if our models could draw their randomness not from code, but from the cosmos?\n\nTo explore this, we must travel not just forward into quantum computing labs, but backward—two thousand years—to the cosmological modeling of ancient China. There, under vastly different paradigms, diviners used the structure of the stars to understand uncertainty. Today, as machine learning confronts the limits of pseudorandomness, it may be time to reconsider the wisdom of their approach—not as mysticism, but as a sophisticated philosophy of prediction that may still hold lessons for us.\n\n---\n\n## The Machinery of Modern Randomness\n\nEvery modern predictive model is seeded—literally—with randomness. Initialize a neural net, and you draw weights from a (pseudo)random distribution. Train it, and your optimizer stochastically samples mini-batches. Tune it, and your hyperparameters are often selected via random search. Even ensemble methods like Random Forests and bagging hinge on randomness to create diversity among models.\n\nBut under the hood, that “randomness” is the product of deterministic algorithms: pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) like the Mersenne Twister. These are mathematically clever but fundamentally predictable systems. Given the same seed, they produce the same sequence. In many contexts, this is a virtue—allowing reproducibility and control. But it comes at a cost. Subtle correlations can emerge in parallel systems. Overused PRNG sequences can create blind spots in simulations, particularly in tail-risk scenarios. The very uniformity that makes them statistically appealing also limits their expressive power when it comes to capturing nature’s true unpredictability.\n\nThis limitation has led some researchers to imagine alternatives: training neural networks whose seeds come not from a PRNG but from quantum entropy harvested on superconducting chips, or from photons arriving from distant quasars. These seeds would not be just “random enough” but fundamentally unpredictable—drawn from processes no deterministic algorithm could replicate.\n\n---\n\n## The Cosmic Randomness of the Ancient World\n\nIf that sounds futuristic, it may surprise us to learn that a kindred idea existed in ancient China. There, divination systems like **Qimen Dunjia (奇门遁甲)**, **Da Liu Ren (大六壬)**, and **Tai Yi Shen Shu (太乙神数)** sought to model uncertainty by observing the heavens—not metaphorically, but mathematically. These systems were grounded in rigorous astronomical cycles: solar terms, planetary movements, and the sexagenary calendar, all encoded into instruments like the **shi pan**—a physical device combining a circular heaven-plate and a square earth-plate, embodying the ancient maxim that “Heaven is round, Earth is square.”\n\nEach chart generated by these tools was not a static horoscope but a computational simulation: a symbolic rendering of the cosmic forces at a precise moment in space and time. The goal was not to foretell certainties, but to understand tendencies, to model the configuration of cyclical forces acting on a situation. In a sense, these were early attempts to bring complexity science into practical decision-making—employing systems theory long before the term existed.\n\nCrucially, these divinatory methods did not treat randomness as uniform. Yarrow stalk casting in the **Yijing**, for instance, generates a skewed distribution favoring “old yin” and “old yang” outcomes—reflecting a belief in asymmetric transformation rather than equal likelihood. This view of randomness is neither deterministic nor purely stochastic—it is epistemic, bounded by human understanding of an ever-shifting cosmos.\n\n---\n\n## A Philosophical Crossroads: What Is Randomness?\n\nThis convergence of ancient divination and modern quant modeling invites deeper reflection. What do we mean when we say something is “random”? What kind of truth do we claim when we attempt to model the future?\n\nIn the **ancient worldview**, randomness was not chaos but complexity. Events were driven by cyclical patterns too vast and intricate for the human mind to fully grasp. The act of divination—far from superstition—was an attempt to situate oneself within those patterns, to glean orientation amidst uncertainty. Prediction meant attunement, not control.\n\nBy contrast, **modern finance and science** emerged from Enlightenment rationalism. Truth became empirical, probability became a calculus, and randomness came to be defined by ignorance—complexity beyond our measurement, noise in our equations. We simulate randomness not to reflect the cosmos, but to test our models under statistical pressure. This is the logic of backtests, confidence intervals, and p-values: a pragmatic, if limited, frame.\n\nYet **quantum physics** disrupts even this. In quantum mechanics, some events are not merely unpredictable—they are uncaused. Randomness becomes ontological. Quantum entropy cannot be reduced to hidden variables or better instruments. At the same time, **postmodern philosophy** destabilizes the very idea of objective modeling, emphasizing the constructed nature of systems, the reflexivity of markets, and the performativity of prediction itself.\n\nIn this tangled web of perspectives, one insight persists: our models are not the world—they are tools. Every model, whether ancient or modern, is a lens. The clearer the lens, the more skillfully we can act—but the lens is never the landscape.\n\n---\n\n## Toward a New Randomness: Cosmic Seeds for Computational Models\n\nSo what does it mean to bring true randomness into machine learning?\n\n**Model diversity** benefits immediately. Ensembles of models trained with PRNG seeds share statistical heritage. Their errors, though varied, may stem from similar algorithmic biases. But if we seed models with entropy derived from quantum phenomena or astronomical noise, we inject a fundamentally different kind of uncertainty. The result: more diverse models, better at capturing edge cases, more robust to black swan events.\n\nNext, consider **hyperparameter optimization**. Randomized grid or Bayesian search methods often inadvertently cluster trials due to the structure of PRNGs. By sourcing randomness from a physically unpredictable stream, we can escape these local minima—each trial becomes not just a statistical variant, but a cosmically independent probe.\n\nThen comes **stress-testing and scenario analysis**. Financial risk models rely on simulations of market paths—hypothetical futures generated by PRNGs. But if the randomness used is too uniform, too sterile, we may under-sample real-world volatility. By contrast, randomness drawn from quasars or quantum systems may better reflect the entropy of the real world—producing test cases that expose hidden vulnerabilities.\n\nThis isn’t mysticism; it’s methodological evolution. By choosing different sources of randomness, we alter the character of our simulations. We shape the texture of our models. In a world increasingly defined by complex, adaptive systems—markets, climate, geopolitics—embracing richer forms of randomness may not just be useful, but necessary.\n\n---\n\n## Ancient Rhythms, Modern Features: Reimagining Data in Financial Models\n\nThere’s another lesson from the ancients: the value of **layered rhythms**. Chinese divination systems did not rely on a single time scale. They interwove daily cycles, seasonal transitions, lunar phases, and solar movements into a single coherent framework. This multi-rhythmic approach offered a more nuanced understanding of timing and influence—capturing both long-term drift and short-term turbulence.\n\nModern quants might do well to borrow from this. Too often, financial models overlook structured temporal effects: the earnings calendar, central bank meetings, volatility regimes. Incorporating structured, rhythm-aware features into our models—whether through Fourier transforms, wavelet decompositions, or calendar-based embeddings—could improve both performance and interpretability.\n\nJust as the ancients read the heavens to understand the moment, today’s models must learn to read structured time.\n\n---\n\n## Toward a New Philosophy of Prediction\n\nUltimately, this convergence of ancient divination and modern quant points us to a richer philosophy of modeling—one that recognizes the limits of control and the value of humility.\n\nWe no longer believe in fate as the ancients did, nor in perfect determinism as the early moderns hoped. We live in a world of **partial knowledge**, **non-stationarity**, and **reflexivity**—where models influence behavior, and behavior feeds back into models. In such a world, the goal is not perfect foresight but informed navigation.\n\nThe ancients taught us to align with cycles; modern statistics taught us to quantify likelihoods; quantum mechanics reminds us that some uncertainty is irreducible. The future of prediction may lie not in choosing one paradigm over another, but in fusing them—combining empirical rigor with structural awareness, algorithmic power with cosmic humility.\n\n---\n\n## Looking Ahead: Toward a More Resilient Modeling Practice\n\nThe next evolution in quantitative modeling may not be faster GPUs or larger datasets, but smarter randomness—sourced not from deterministic algorithms alone, but from the fundamental unpredictability of the universe. As we begin to seed our models with quantum entropy or photon timestamps, we enter a new era of simulation—one where each model carries a fingerprint of the cosmos.\n\nWe should ask ourselves:\n\n- How might ensembles seeded from quantum sources fare during market regime shifts?\n\n- Can we incorporate lunar or seasonal rhythms into real-time trading signals?\n\n- Might hybrid models—symbolic and statistical, ancient and modern—offer not just accuracy, but insight?\n\nAt stake is more than just better predictions. It’s a deeper understanding of uncertainty itself—and a recognition that, whether through the sky-charts of a Han-era diviner or the code of a Python Monte Carlo loop, our quest is the same: to find structure in the chaos, and to act wisely within it.\n\nIn the end, perhaps the most powerful seed we can plant is not a number from a generator, but a renewed philosophy of what it means to model, to predict, and to know.\n\n[Read full article in Chinese with interactive features](/blogs/20250719-084902.html)"
